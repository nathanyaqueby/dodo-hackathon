### More about DODO
Deepwaters of Digital Ocean (DODO) is a week-long research-based series of events focused on engagement with exponential technologies. 
DODO operates on the intersections of art–technology–science–society and works through three clusters – AI, virtual realities, and blockchains – for ideas and investigations into the Ocean. With an emphasis on multidisciplinarity, innovation, and regenerative solutions, we intend to establish new proposals 
for the blue world through three hybrid formats: workshops, a symposium and a hackathon.
